            <p><b>My class has completed an exchange. Can I sign the class up again?</b></p>
            <p>Absolutely. Your classes are welcome to participate as many times as they want.</p>
            <p><b>I signed my class up a while ago, but the no exchange match has been made. What can I do?</b></p>
            <p>This means that there has not yet been another class that has signed up that matches the criteria of your class. The criterias are that the two classes must be in the same age group and must be registered for the same term. If your class has not been matched by the end of a term, you will be notified by mail. You can then register your class for the next term and re-initiate the exchange.</p>
            <p><b>My class has been matched and the exchange is confirmed by both classes, but the other teacher is unresponsive. What can I do?</b></p>
            <p>In this case, we recommend that you cancel the exchange (on the Overview page) and re-initiate the your class for a new exchange. Unfortunately, there is little we can do to change a circumstance of this kind, though we know that there will be other teachers and classes signing up in the future.</p>
